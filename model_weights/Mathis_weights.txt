Mathis weights:
Min max scaling on train set ( 1850-2000) for inputs
dropout 0.2 before conv3d
normalization for both input and output done globally instead of locally (over all axis)

Version1: first try, prototype
on_historic: train with data until 2014
on_train: train with data until 2000, validate with 14 yrs. 
normalization also depends on train data set
